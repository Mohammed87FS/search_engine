C++ Basics

C++ is a powerful programming language that supports multiple paradigms.
RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) is a fundamental C++ pattern.
Smart pointers like unique_ptr and shared_ptr help manage memory automatically.
Move semantics allow efficient transfer of resources without copying.

Modern C++ emphasizes value semantics and const correctness.
The STL provides containers, algorithms, and iterators for common tasks.
